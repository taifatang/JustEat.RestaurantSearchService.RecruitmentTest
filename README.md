Just Eat Engineer Recruitment Test
==================================

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

* [A coding test](#coding-test)
* [A few technical questions](#technical-questions)

In order to avoid bounced emails we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant ZIP file to a shared Google Drive folder. In order to obtain the URL for this folder, please supply your Gmail or Google-based email address to either your agent or the Just Eat member of staff who assigned you the test.

Please make this a **single** zip file named `{yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip` containing:

1. a single markdown file with the answers to the technical questions
2. one folder containing the technical test

## Coding Test

Just Eat has a public API available at [https://uk.api.just-eat.io/](https://uk.api.just-eat.io/) that you will use to get restaurant information, including restaurant details and delivery information. We'd specifically like you to use the `SearchByPostcode` endpoint that is documented at [https://uk.api.just-eat.io/docs#operation/SearchByPostcode](https://uk.api.just-eat.io/docs#operation/SearchByPostcode).

As an example, [https://uk.api.just-eat.io/restaurants/bypostcode/ec4m](https://uk.api.just-eat.io/restaurants/bypostcode/ec4m) returns a list of restaurants that deliver to the outcode EC4M, including some basic restaurant information.

The task is to create an application that accepts an outcode as a parameter. The application should then display the following information about each restaurant that delivers to that outcode by querying our API:

- Name
- Rating
- Types of food for the restaurant

### Platform Choice

You can create the application as either a command line application, web application or mobile application in any of the following platforms

- .NET, Python or JavaScript/TypeScript (can use Angular/React/Vue.js) for web applications. **Please note, due to CORS, calls directly from the browser will fail.**
- .NET or Python for command line applications
- iOS, Android or Windows Mobile for mobile applications

Think about the type of work you would like to do at Just Eat and **choose an appropriate application type and platform**.

### Task requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met. However, we understand people have busy lives and would guide you to spend no more than 2-3 hours on a submission. We also take into consideration the [Answers to technical questions.md](#technical-questions) file and what you would like to have added if you had more time. You should look at this as the complete solution, it's much quicker to explain what you would like to have done than code it.

- Please complete the user story below.
- Your code should compile and run in one step.
- Feel free to use whatever frameworks / libraries / packages you like.
- You **must** include tests
- Please avoid including artifacts from your local build (such as NuGet packages or the bin folder(s)) in your final ZIP file

### User Story

Given I am a **user running the application**
When I **submit an outcode (e.g. SE19)**
Then I want to see a **list of restaurants**
And I only want to see **restaurants that are currently open**

If you have chosen a native mobile application platform please also include the following:

Given I am a **user running the application**
When I **submit an outcode (e.g. SE19)**
Then I want to see a **list of restaurants**
And I only want to see **restaurants that are currently open**
And I want to see **the restaurant logo alongside the restaurant information** 

Given I am a **user running the application**
When I click "auto detect outcode" it should **use GPS to find my current postcode to retrieve restaurant results**
Then I want to see a **list of restaurants**
And I only want to see **restaurants that are currently open**
And I want to see **the restaurant logo alongside the restaurant information**

#### Acceptance criteria

- For the known outcode `ec4m`, results are returned
- The Name, Cuisine Types and Rating of the restaurant are displayed

# Technical questions

Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
4. How would you improve the Just Eat APIs that you just used?


#### Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!
